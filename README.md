    <h1>Hi, I'm Alisa</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a project manager with a combined <strong>8+ years of experience</strong> in the global food industry and IT.
        While adept at leading and motivating teams, I'm also a junior developer passionate about learning and contributing to exciting projects.
    </p>
    <p>Currently, I'm honing my skills in <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> and actively seeking opportunities to participate in open-source projects or develop <strong>interactive and dynamic websites</strong>.</p>
    <p>
        In my project management role, I bring strong expertise across all project lifecycle phases, from strategic planning to execution and evaluation.
        I'm comfortable leading and motivating cross-functional international teams.
